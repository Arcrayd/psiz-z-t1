# Task 1 

## List implementation

This repository is intended to be used during the online classes. The aim of the task is to implement the list in cpp language in agile methodology. 

## What shall be implemented? 

I would like to use list implementation in the application for parking lot. 
You can find here-after an example of the code that shall be provided to the user : 

int main()
{
  List * pFirstFloor = initList(); // I can create one list per parking floor
  addCar(pFirstFloor, "EL020GM", time()); // I can add cars with plate numbers and time of enetry
  printAll(pFirstFloor); // I can print all the elements from the list
  removeCar(pFirstFloor, "EL020GM"); // I can remove cars using their plate numbers
  deinitList(pFirstFloor); //I destroy the created list
}

## How the project shall be structured

I would like to have three files: 
- parkingList.hpp
- parkingList.cpp
- main.cpp 

## How we do start?

1. Toolchain - we must agree on common toolchain used for this project
2. parkingList.hpp - Before writing any line of code and any compiling it, we will agree on the list design.
